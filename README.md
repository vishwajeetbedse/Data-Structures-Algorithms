# Data Structures & Algorithms 

Welcome to my repository for LeetCode solutions! This repo serves as a digital journal of my journey through competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Languages:** C++, Java, Python
* **Tools:** LeetHub (Automatic Sync)
* **Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Vishwajeet_Bedse/)

## 📂 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by the LeetHub extension, typically following this hierarchy:
* Each folder corresponds to a LeetCode problem.
* Inside each folder, you'll find:
    * The solution file (e.g., `solution.cpp` or `solution.java`).
    * A `README.md` generated by LeetHub containing the problem description and difficulty level.

## 📈 Goals
- [ ] Master 300+ LeetCode problems.
- [ ] Improve time and space complexity analysis ($O(n)$, $O(\log n)$, etc.).
- [ ] Build a strong foundation for technical interviews.

## 🔗 Useful Resources
* [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
* [Striver’s A2Z DSA Course]([https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z])
